4. **Connect your repository**
5. **Render will automatically configure everything based on `render.yaml`**

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

- You'll see logs showing the progress
- Once complete, you'll get a URL like: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

### Step 5: Create Admin User

After deployment, create a superuser to manage your content:

1. **Go to your Render dashboard**
2. **Click on your web service**
3. **Go to "Shell" tab**
4. **Run these commands:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
5. **Follow the prompts to create your admin account**

2. **Login with your superuser credentials**
3. **Start adding your projects, updating content, etc.**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails**
- Check that all files are in the correct location
- Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- Check the build logs for specific errors

**Static Files Not Loading**
- Make sure `whitenoise` is in your `requirements.txt`
- Verify `STATIC_ROOT` is set in settings
- Check that `collectstatic` runs during build

**Database Errors**
- Render automatically provides PostgreSQL
- Make sure `dj-database-url` and `psycopg2-binary` are in requirements
- Check that migrations run during build

**500 Server Error**
- Check the logs in your Render dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Make sure `DEBUG=false` in production

### Getting Help

4. **Add your domain and configure DNS**

### Monitoring

- **Uptime**: Render provides automatic uptime monitoring
- **Logs**: Access real-time logs in your dashboard
- **Performance**: Monitor response times and resource usage

### Updates

To update your deployed application:
1. **Push changes to your GitHub repository**
2. **Render will automatically redeploy**
3. **No manual intervention needed**
